BasicPlotter
============

This is my rendering of a very basic plotter..
On entering an expression interms of variable x, its converted into postfix form and an expression-tree is created which is 
used for incremental and iterative evaluation.

At present, it can be used to view crude approximations of graphs..
Will be including additional features soon..
Please feel free to explore and contribute..
